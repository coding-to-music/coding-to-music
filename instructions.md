# Original Idea and description is in this Medium article by Thomas Guibert

From this medium article by Thomas Guibert, ullstack developer from Lorient, France, currently living in  Stockholm, Sweden.  
[How to Create a Self-Updating README.md for Your GitHub Profile](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-a-self-updating-readme-md-for-your-github-profile-f8b05744ca91)

[Link to his working repo](https://github.com/thmsgbrt/thmsgbrt)

GitHub recently released a feature that allows users to create a profile-level `README.md` file, that is displayed on your profile page, above repositories.

- Create a new repo with the same name as your github name
- Mine is coding-to-music/coding-to-music  
- If you check the box to have a Readme supplied you can see it in your profile immediately  

## go to your project directory
```java
git clone the repo
cd coding-to-music
npm init
npm i mustache
```

## code main.mustache  
```java
// main.mustache 
My name is {{name}} and today is {{date}}.
```

## code index.js
```javascript
// index.js
const Mustache = require('mustache');
const fs = require('fs');
const MUSTACHE_MAIN_DIR = './main.mustache';
/**
  * DATA is the object that contains all
  * the data to be provided to Mustache
  * Notice the "name" and "date" property.
*/
let DATA = {
  name: 'Thomas',
  date: new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-GB', {
    weekday: 'long',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: 'numeric',
    timeZoneName: 'short',
    timeZone: 'Europe/Stockholm',
  }),
};
/**
  * A - We open 'main.mustache'
  * B - We ask Mustache to render our file with the data
  * C - We create a README.md file with the generated output
  */
function generateReadMe() {
  fs.readFile(MUSTACHE_MAIN_DIR, (err, data) =>  {
    if (err) throw err;
    const output = Mustache.render(data.toString(), DATA);
    fs.writeFileSync('README.md', output);
  });
}
generateReadMe();
```

This was the version I ended up putting in my own  
```java
let DATA = {
  name: 'Tom',
  refresh_date: new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
    weekday: 'long',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric',
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: 'numeric',
    timeZoneName: 'short',
    timeZone: 'America/New_York',
  }),
};
```

### With that, you can now run  
```java
node index.js 
```
in your terminal and it should generate a brand new `README.md` file in the same directory:  
```java
// Generated content in README.md
My name is Thomas and today is Wednesday, December 10.
```

### Awesome! Commit and push everything. 
### Now, you can see that your README.md displayed on your Profile page has been updated. 

<p align="center">...</p>

## Generate your README automatically with Github Actions:  

That’s great but you don’t want to be having to commit a new version of your `README.md` every day. Let’s automate this!  

We are going to use GitHub Actions for that. If you have never used it before, this is going to be a good first project.  

### With Actions, you can create workflows to automate tasks. 
Actions live in the same place as the rest of the code, in a special directory: ./.github/worflows .
```java
$ mkdir .github && cd .github && mkdir workflows
```   

In this ./workflows folder, create a ./main.yaml file that will hold our Action.
```java
$ cd ./workflows && touch main.yaml
```
Fill it with this content:

```yaml
name: README build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout current repository to Master branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Setup NodeJs 13.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '13.x'
      - name: Cache dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.
        uses: actions/cache@v1
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-js-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Generate README file
        run: node index.js
      - name: Commit and Push new README.md to the repository
        uses: mikeal/publish-to-github-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This Action has one Job, `build` , that runs on the specified machine, `ubuntu-latest` .  
Lines 3 to 8 define when is triggered this action:
```java
- On every push to the Master branch,
- Or on a specified schedule, here 6 hours.
```
- The scheduler allows you to trigger a workflow at a scheduled time. 
- The cron syntax has five fields separated by a space, and each field represents a unit of time.
- If you want to know more about it and set your own schedule, read the Scheduled Events documentation.
- When triggered, this job will execute the steps one after the other.
- For the rest of the file, read what I wrote next to `name`: to understand what is happening for each step.

Here is what was performed:
```java
connorstom@penguin:~/aprojects/coding-to-music$ git pull origin master
From github.com:coding-to-music/coding-to-music
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date!
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
connorstom@penguin:~/aprojects/coding-to-music$ git push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

## Summary
### So far we have done:
- index.js
- main.mustache
- puppeteer.service.js
- main.yaml
